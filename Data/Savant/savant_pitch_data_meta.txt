Data is of:
All pitcher/pitch type combos with at least 10 pitches since 2015

Columns:
pitches - # pitches by specific pitcher of specific type
player_id - unique id
player_name - player's name (Last, First)
total_pitches - total # pitches thrown by the pitcher since 2015
pitch_percent - % of times pitch type is thrown out of all the pitcher's pitches
ba - hitters' batting average against the pitcher's pitch
iso - isolated power is how often a hitter hit for extra bases
babip - batting average on balls in play
slg - average number of bases per at bat
woba - complicated metric that measures overall offensive value (https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/)
xwoba - expected wOBA (above) calculated using launch angle and exit velocity
xba - expected batting average calculated using launch angle and exit velocity
hits - numerator in batting average
abs - denominator in batting average
launch_speed - exit velocity of a hit ball
launch_angle - launch angle of a hit ball (0 deg is parallel to the ground)
spin_rate - pitch's revolutions per minute
velocity - speed of the pitch, measured out of the hand of the pitcher
effective_speed - perceived speed of the pitch (as perceived by the hitter)
whiffs - swings and misses
swings - total number of swings
takes - total number of takes (batter did not swing)
eff_min_vel - effective speed minus velocity
release_extension - how far from the rubber a pitch is released (in ft)
pos3_int_start_distance - ?
pos4_int_start_distance - ?
pos5_int_start_distance - ?
pos6_int_start_distance - ?
pos7_int_start_distance - ?
pos8_int_start_distance - ?
pos9_int_start_distance - ?
pitcher_run_exp - total change in expected runs (positive=less runs for offense)
run_exp - total change in expected runs (positive=more runs for offense)
bat_speed - avg swing speed measured 6 inches from the head of the bat (started tracking in 2024)
swing_length - avg of the sum distance traveled by the head of the bat in XYZ space from the start of data until contact point (started tracking in 2024)
